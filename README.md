# IBM-Cloud_NSAP-Scheme-Eligibility-Prediction-

Overview
This project builds a multi-class classification system to predict the correct NSAP (National Social Assistance Program) sub-scheme for applicants based on their demographic and socio-economic data.
The model is developed, trained, and deployed on IBM Cloud using Watson Machine Learning and Watsonx.ai Studio.

Proposed Solution
1.Data Collection: AI Kosh NSAP dataset.
2.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, normalization.
3.Model Training: Random Forest / XGBoost classifiers.
4.Deployment: IBM Watson Machine Learning service.
5.Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
6.Prediction: Real-time API endpoint for eligibility checks.

Tools & Technologies:
1.IBM Cloud (Lite/Free)
2.IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
3.IBM Cloud Object Storage
4.Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib)

Features Used:
1.State/District codes
2.Gender counts (male, female, transgender)
3.Caste-wise counts (SC, ST, OBC, General)
4.Aadhaar & mobile number availability

Conclusion
The IBM Cloudâ€“deployed ML model effectively predicts NSAP scheme eligibility.
This automation minimizes allocation errors and ensures timely benefit distribution.
